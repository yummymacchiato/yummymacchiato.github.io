    <h3>Quotes on Code</h3>

    <blockquote>
      "The programmer, like the poet, works
        only slightly removed from pure
        thought-stuff . He
        builds his castles in the air, from
        air, creating by exertion of
        the imagination."<b>&mdash; <a href =
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred
        Brooks</a></b>       
    </blockquote>

          
    <blockquote>      
      "A programmer is ideally an <u>essayist</u> who works with
      traditional <u>aesthetic</u> and <u>literary</u> forms as well
      as mathematical concepts, to <u>communicate</u> the way that an
      algorithm works and to convince a <u>reader</u> that the results
      will be correct." <i>&mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald
      Knuth</a></i>      
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. <em>We've tended to forget that no computer will ever
      ask a new question.</em>" <strong>&mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></strong>
    </blockquote>

    
    <blockquote>
      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." <b>&mdash;
      <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a></b>     
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "Because the process of knowing is inseparable from
      <strike>"languaging,"</strike> "coding," in the new education,
      <strike>language</strike> code (i.e., all forms of symbolic
      codification) is regarded as the mediator of all human
      perception and is used as a unifying and continuing focus of all
      student inquiry."  &mdash;
      <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman">Neil Postman</a>
      and
